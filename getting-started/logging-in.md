#  Logging in to the Developer Portal

Once you've received your developer portal credentials you will need to log in to the developer portal.

> Note: Your developer portal credentials are different than your Vonage Business Cloud credentials and can only be used to log in to the developer portal.

To log in to the developert portal:

* Visit the [Developer Portal](https://developer.vonage.com) homepage.
* Fill out the "Sign in to your account" form with your developer portal credentials.
* Make sure to select "Vonage Business Cloud" as the platform.
* Click "Sign In"

> Now that you're logged, learn how to [create an API application](/getting-started/create-application) to get started using the Vonage Business Cloud APIs.
