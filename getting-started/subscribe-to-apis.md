> By subscribing to the Provisioning API, your Application now has the correct privileges to use the [Account](/vonage-business-cloud/vbc-apis/account-api/overview), [Extension](/vonage-business-cloud/vbc-apis/extension-api/overview) and [User](/vonage-business-cloud/vbc-apis/user-api/overview) APIs. Now that you've subscribed to the Provisioning API, you need to [authenticate](/getting-started/authentication) to make a request.
