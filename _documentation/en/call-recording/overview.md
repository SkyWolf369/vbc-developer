# Call Recording API Overview
The Vonage Business Communications Call Recording API enables you to manage Company and On-Demand Call Recordings.

* Company Call Recording is rule based and will automatically record calls that meet the configured criteria. Company Call Recording ruels are configured by an administrator. 
* On-Demand Call Recording lets employees decide when to record calls. On-Demand Call Recording can be started or stopped on an active call by the employee.

The Call Recording APIs will enable you to build automation workflows using call recording metadata and their associated audio recordings.

* List call recording metadata
* Get single call recording metadata
* Delete call recordings
* Download call recording audio files
* Export call recording in bulk asynchronously
