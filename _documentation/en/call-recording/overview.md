# Call Recording API Overview

The Vonage Business Communications Call Recording API enables you to manage **Company** and **On-Demand Call Recordings**.

* **Company Call Recording** is rule based and will automatically record calls that meet the configured criteria. Company Call Recording rules are configured by an administrator. 
* **On-Demand Call Recording** allows employees to decide when to record calls. On-Demand Call Recording can be started or stopped on an active call by the employee.

The Call Recording APIs will enable you to build automation workflows using call recording metadata and their associated audio recordings:

* List call recording metadata
* Get single call recording metadata
* Delete call recordings
* Download call recording audio files
* Asynchronously export call recording in bulk
